You have done it, after hours of effort you fixed an ugly bug locally.  You create a pull request on the upstream repository and wait - and wait.  You have hit wall - what can you do to get your pull request merged?

I have found myself in this situations many times, and I expect to find myself in these same stalled scenarios from time to time.  The following is a set of tools that I use to solve common problems when creating pull requests alongside a list strategies that I wish contributors when I reviewed their pull requests.

## Get Engagement with Maintainers
When working with open-source software sometimes you will get an immediate response and voila your changes are merged.  In the more likely case the maintainers are busy and you will need to figure out how to get your pull request the attention it needs to be merged.

### Working with the Project
GitHub has many tools in place to help contributors be successful.  By following these hints to contribution you will better understand the expectations you work towards your pull request being merged. 

#### Follow CONTRIBUTING.MD
Contribution guidelines are often documented.  This will include all kinds of contributions beyond pull request

#### Fill in Templates

#### Find Examples

### Finding the Right Maintainers
When projects are large and expertise is spread over many areas, you will want to find the expert that will be most familiar with the kind of change you are proposing.
